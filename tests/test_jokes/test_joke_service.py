    This test is flaky in theory, but in practice, it should not fail in any reasonable number of test runs.

    Explanation:

    With three distinct values, the first sample will always be a new joke. The second sample will be a new one with a probability of 2/3. The third sample will be new with a probability of either 1/3 or 2/3 depending on the outcome of the second sample, the former being the more probable one.

    To make the problem easier, let's first look at only getting two out of the three jokes.
    With a mere 10 samples, the probability of not getting two out of three jokes is (1-2/3)^9 ≈ 0.00005 = 1/20 000 and with 20 samples, we already get the probability down to (1-2/3)^19 which is less than 1 000 000 000.

    Then, we need to get our final joke. Now, assuming a situation where we have already sampled two out of three jokes, the probability of getting the last joke is 1/3. The probability of not getting the last joke in 10 samples is much higher this time; (1-1/3)^9 ≈ 0.026 ≈ 1/30, but with 50 samples, we are again at extremely low probabilities (1-1/3)^49 ≈ 1.5 / 1 000 000 000.
