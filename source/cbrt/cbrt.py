Assingment: 

Newtonâ€™s method for cube roots is based on the fact that if [y] is an approximation to the cube root of [x] , 
then a better approximation is given by the value [\frac{x / y^2 + 2 \times y} 3.] Use this formula to implement 
a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root procedure.
